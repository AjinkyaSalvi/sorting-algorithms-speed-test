Bubble Sort

01.	Program Details:

	(i)	Date: 15th November, 2019
	(ii)	Language: Java

02.	Problem Statement:

	(i)	Sort elements using the Bubble Sort.
	(ii)	Measure total time taken to sort.

03.	Working:

	In bubble sort, I have completed entire program in ‘main’ function.
	In which, my program first accepts the inputs from user.
	Then, array is sorted by simple swapping.
	Finally, result is displayed to the user.

04.	Code Execution:

	(i)	To compile the above programs,
		change the directory of the Terminal or Command Prompt to the folder containing these files.

	(ii)	Then, enter 'javac BubbleSort.java' to compile the code.
		You can only run it after compiling.

	(iii)	Finally, to run it correctly,
		enter 'java BubbleSort'.

05.	Note:

	Speed of bubble sort can be improved in many number of ways.
	a)	Like by ignoring comparisons of elements which have already been compared in earlier iterations.
	b)	Also, a flag can be inserted in the 'for' loop.
		If no swapping is done in the for loop, then array is already sorted.
		So, by using flag, we can exit for loop, rather than trying to sort already sorted array.
